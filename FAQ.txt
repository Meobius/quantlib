QuantLib Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. Generic questions

- Is it OK to email a QuantLib developer to ask questions, or seek help,
  or report a bug?

  Yes, it is.  However, we urge you to consider posting to the
  QuantLib mailing list instead.  This is for two reasons.  The first
  is that messages on the list are stored: the next one with your
  problem will be able to find the answer by searching the archives.
  The second is that you might get your answer sooner.  For instance,
  it just so happens that I am writing this entry in the middle of a
  two-weeks period without an Internet connection.  If anybody wrote
  me last Monday, the poor soul will wait two weeks for an answer
  which could have been given already by someone else on the list.

  However, if your intent in writing was to call the developer names,
  disregard the above.  By all means write personally to the
  developer.  And possibly, add the line:
    X-Bogosity: Yes
  to the mail headers, so that our filters---I mean, WE can take
  immediate care of it.
