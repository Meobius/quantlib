    \brief MultiPath implements multiple paths evolving at the same time

    $Source$
    $Name$
    $Log$
    Revision 1.1  2001/04/09 14:05:48  nando
    all the *.hpp moved below the Include/ql level

    Revision 1.3  2001/04/06 18:46:20  nando
    changed Authors, Contributors, Licence and copyright header

    Revision 1.2  2001/04/04 12:13:23  nando
    Headers policy part 2:
    The Include directory is added to the compiler's include search path.
    Then both your code and user code specifies the sub-directory in
    #include directives, as in
    #include <Solvers1d/newton.hpp>

    Revision 1.1  2001/04/04 11:07:22  nando
    Headers policy part 1:
    Headers should have a .hpp (lowercase) filename extension
    All *.h renamed to *.hpp

    Revision 1.1  2001/01/25 16:11:17  marmar
    MultiPath, the first step for a multi-dimensional Monte Carlo
