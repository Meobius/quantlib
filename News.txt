  - added currency classes; CurrencyTag replaced in library code;
  - added money class providing arithmetic with or without conversions;
    tests provided;
  - added exchange-rate class; tests provided;
  - added exchange-rate manager with smart rate lookup, i.e., able to
    derive a missing exchange rate as a chain of provided rates; tests

  direction integers as provided by Bratley and Fox, who credited unpublished
  work of Sobol' and Levitan.

- Added an implementation of Sobol sequences using the coefficients of the free
  direction integers of Lemieux, Cieslak, and Luttmer. Coefficients for d<=40
  are the same as in Bradley-Fox. For dimension 40<d<=360 the coefficients have
  been calculated as optimal values based on the "resolution" criterion. The
  values has been provided by Christiane Lemieux, private communication,
  September 2004.
