LIBRARY

    contact Broda

    MONTE CARLO FRAMEWORK
        add example of Martingale control variate
        add examples of Montecarlo internal and Montecarlo convergence
        have random generator as input
        have statistics class as input

    FINITE DIFFERENCE FRAMEWORK
        boundary conditions as in Wilmott
        Douglas scheme (QuEP)
        Richardson extrapolation (QuEP)
        SOR for free boundary condition
        have time scheme as input

    ASIAN:
        continuous geometric APO backward starting instead of forward starting
        introduce continuous geometric ASO
        handle backward starting asian

    OPTIMIZATION FRAMEWORK:
        create a framework similar to the Solver1d framework
        add GALib (genetic algorithm)
        add COOOL algorithms


    Maxim integral

    QuEP:
        Currency as class with methods returning related info
        implement currency as per OMG definition

    document namespaces on InterestRateDerivatives, Optimizers

    introduce compoundpathpricer
    GaussianPathGenerator, etc: allow for more general random walks


    what about barrier or FD with dividends ???
    revisite model/slice interface

    QuEP:
        Payoff class from EuropeanOption into QuantLib
        redesign payoff class for integral (Green) option pricing, step
        condition, strategy, etc.


    add futures convexity adjustment
    cash flow stream for IRR, duration
    QuantLib dynamic Win32 library (QuantLib.dll)
    develop C++ unit test suite based on boost
    clean up accuracy definition in solver1D (x or f(x) accuracy ?)
    implement round as per OMG enumeration/definition
    add one-touch option (american binary)
    implement dividendRho for dividendOption
    redesign segment integral
    add historicalvolatility to RiskMeasures
    rename all files/dirs to lowercase no spaces (except INSTALL, TODO?)
    histogram class
    contact M. Higgings
