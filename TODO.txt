MonteCarloModel refactoring (remove old classes)

DISTRIBUTING
    RPM package

COMPILING
    borland compiler build tree indipendent from source tree
    check compile success/failure on other platforms/compilers
    Borland projects

LIBRARY
    check our geometric asioan with results in Haug pag 96
    Nicolas spline contribution
    Maxim integral
    introduce size_t where appropriate
    Payoff class from EuropeanOption into QuantLib
    timer class
    switch false/true antithetic variate
    add futures (and convexity adjustment) to the bootstrapping method
    allow for negative dividendYield (that is cost of carry)
    cash flow stream for IRR, duration
    Currency as class with methods returning related info
    QuantLib dynamic Win32 library (QuantLib.dll)
    develop C++ unit test suite based on
        http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit
    clean up accuracy definition in solver1D (x or f(x) accuracy ?)
    implement currency as per OMG definition
    implement round as per OMG enumeration/definition
    add one-touch option (american binary)
    GaussianPathGenerator, etc: allow for more general random walks
    implement dividendRho for dividendOption
    redesign payoff class for integral (Green) option pricing, step
        condition, etc
    redesign segment integral
    what about barrier or FD with dividends ???
    revisite model/slice interface
    add historicalvolatility to RiskMeasures
    rename all files/dirs to lowercase no spaces (except INSTALL, TODO?)
    histogram class

DOCUMENTATION ***
    add MS-Windows Help and TeX DVI format.
    enforce fulpath&classesinclude DoxyGen requirements
    add/update DoxyGen TODO with CVS TODO.txt file
