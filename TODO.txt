MultiPath e MultiPathPricer
matrici di covarianza

FINITE DIFFERENCE FRAMEWORK
-*use DicretisedAsset instead of array
-*use TimeGrid
-*use assetGrid
-*allow for time dependant parameters
-*boundary conditions as in Wilmott
-*Douglas scheme (QuEP)
-*Richardson extrapolation (QuEP)
-*SOR rollback for free boundary condition
-*replace all xxAtCenter with more general not "centered" functions
- clean up FDMultiPeriodOption
- check american with discrete dividends
- merge rollback scheme with tree rollback scheme

MONTE CARLO FRAMEWORK
-*revise multidimensional MonteCarlo
-*revise extrapolation in diffusion process
-*quasi-random number generator (Faure, Sobol)
-*replace all instance of seed with a random generator
- add example of Martingale control variate
- add examples of Montecarlo internal and Montecarlo convergence
- add Milstein Scheme
- Hypersphere approximation for non positive semi definite correlation
  matrices
- use brownian bridge in sequence generation

- move all (Multi)PathPricer under a folder (namesapace?) PathPricers

VOLATILITY
-*local volatility
- investigate extrapolation effect, consider one side differences,
  instead of central, when on the border
- visitor pattern
- blackSurface: check time extrapolation

PRICING ENGINE FRAMEWORK

QuEP
- Currency as class with methods returning related info
- implement currency as per OMG definition

DOCUMENTATION
- http://www.iisec.com/
- use tidy (if available) on the HTML documentation
- enforce fulpath&classesinclude DoxyGen requirements
- add/update FAQ material in QuantLib-site TOD.txt

YIELD CURVE
- future convexity adjustment
- end of year turn

TREES
- check addDates
- BS correction
- merge rollback scheme with FD rollback scheme
- trinomial trees
- implied trinomial trees

COMPILING
- borland compiler build tree indipendent from source tree
- check compile success/failure on other platforms/compilers available @SF
- Borland projects


+Changes to the Web Site
  * Improve documentation, maybe add a web-log where web-surfer can leave
    their remarks
  * Update the "to do" list
  * Draw a road map of future works

+Importance of Unit Testing
  The idea is to certify the quality of QuantLib using a unit-test framework.
  The tests would also serve as concrete examples on how the library should
  be used.
  QuantLib would be defined by what is tested, all the major features should
  be tested. In this way it will also be possible to maintain the synchronization
  of QuantLib with QuantLib.NET.
  All the tests in python will be moved to corresponding tests written in C++.

+Changes to the Library
  * Improve the documentation
  * Move to the Instrument/pricing engine framework
  * Refactor of the Finite-Difference framework merging with
    the Tree/Lattice framework
  * Develop a framework for stochastic processes
  * Build basic Bond classes
