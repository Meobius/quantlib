    Visual C++ 6.0/7.1 projects files are supplied for building the library.

    If you use Borland command line compiler (5.5.1) the make options are:
    -D_DEBUG (debug), -D_RTLDLL (dynamic linking of runtime library),
    -D_MT__ (multi-thread) as in:

    make all
    make -D_DEBUG all
    make -D_RTLDLL all
    make -D_RTLDLL -D_DEBUG all
    make -D__MT__ all
    make -D__MT__ -D_DEBUG all
    make -D__MT__ -D_RTLDLL all
    make -D__MT__ -D_RTLDLL -D_DEBUG all

    Before compiling the library, you might want to edit the file
    "ql/userconfig.hpp" and enable additional features by uncommenting
    the relevant lines.
