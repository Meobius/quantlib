		QuantLib --- the open source library for quantitative finance
		-------------------------------------------------------------
		                http://quantlib.org/

Documentation for the QuantLib library is both online and downloadable in a
number of formats from <http://quantlib.org>.
You are going to need it. Trust us.

Basic documentation is also available (although not extremely readable) in the
*.docs files in the Docs directory.

The file Docs\README.txt details how to produce documentation from the sources
if one is willing to do so.
