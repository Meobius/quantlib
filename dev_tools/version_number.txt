The convention for the names of the CVS branches is Rxxyyzzln where:
R stand for Release
xx is the major number
yy is the minor number
zz is the minor-minor number
l  can be a,b,f for alpha, beta, final respectively
n  is an ordinal number

e.g. R000300a2 stands for Release 0.3.1a2

The version number is in:
    QuantLib/configure.in,
    QuantLib/QuantLib.nsi,
    QuantLib/Docs/quantlib.doxy,
    QuantLib/ql/qldefines.hpp,
    QuantLib-Python/setup.py
    QuantLib-Python/QuantLib/SWIG/ql.i

It's also in some script used for automatic building:
    release-job.sh
    release-job.bat
    night-job.bat
