The convention for the names of the CVS branches is Rxxyyzzln where:
R stand for Release
xx is the major number
yy is the minor number
zz is the minor-minor number
l  can be a,b,f for alpha, beta, final respectively
n  is an ordinal number

e.g. R000300a2 stands for Release 0.3.1a2
e.g. R000300f0 stands for Release 0.3.1f0
