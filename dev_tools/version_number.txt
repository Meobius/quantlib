The convention for the names of the CVS branches is Rxxyyzzln where:
R stand for Release
xx is the major number
yy is the minor number
zz is the minor-minor number
l  can be a,b,f for alpha, beta, final respectively
n  is an ordinal number; 0 is only allowed when l equals f

e.g. R000300a2 stands for Release 0.3.1a2
e.g. R000301f0 stands for Release 0.3.1f0

The current version number is 0.3.3a1 - 000303a1

This version number is in:
    QuantLib/dev_tools/version_number.txt,
    QuantLib/configure.ac,
    QuantLib/QuantLib.nsi,
    QuantLib/Docs/quantlib.doxy,
    QuantLib/ql/qldefines.hpp,

    QuantLib-SWIG/SWIG/ql.i
    QuantLib-SWIG/Python/setup.py
    QuantLib-SWIG/Ruby/setup.rb
    QuantLib-SWIG/Scheme/MzScheme/setup.scm
    QuantLib-SWIG/Scheme/Guile/setup.scm

    QuantLib-Excel/qlxl/qlxl.hpp

It's also in some script used by RiskMap for automatic building:
    night-job.bat
    night-job2.bat

A few RiskMap automatic building scripts have the previous release number

    release-job.sh
    release-job.bat
