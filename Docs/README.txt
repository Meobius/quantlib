The documentation is automatically extracted from the source code using
Doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org). The suggested version is 1.3.4; versions
as back as 1.2.14 should still work.

The basic requirement to produce html documentation are:
1) Doxygen
2) Graphviz (http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/)
3) Aladdin Ghostscript (http://www.ghostscript.com/)

If you want to produce PDF and/or PS documentation you will need also:
4) TeX/LaTeX
5) epstopdf. It's available as Perl script (you will also need Perl, of
   course), C source to be compiled or Windows executable.
The above, and any additional packages your LaTeX installation might need, 
are available through the CTAN (http://www.ctan.org/)

To produce HTML documentation:
1) Install Doxygen. You will also need to add to your PATH doxygen-x.x.x\bin.
2) Install Graphviz. Add to your PATH Graphviz\bin
3) Install Ghostscript. Add to your path gs\gsx.xx\bin
4) a) Borland user: type 'make html' in the Docs directory
   b) VC user: go to the Docs directory and type:
      doxygen quantlib.doxy

If you want to produce TeX/PDF/PS documentation:
5) install MiKTeX 2 or higher from http://www.miktex.org
6) download http://www.tex.ac.uk/tex-archive/support/epstopdf/epstopdf.exe
   and copy it into a directory on your path
7) a) Borland users: type 'make ps' or 'make pdf' from the Docs
      directory
   b) VC user: go to the Docs\latex directory and type:
        latex refman
        makeindex refman.idx
        latex refman
      for PostScript output or
        pdflatex refman
        makeindex refman.idx
        pdflatex refman
      for PDF output.
   Just ignore TeX/LaTeX warning/error.

If you want to compile the HTML documentation into Microsoft Help format:
8) download and install the HTML Help Workshop from
   msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/vsconhh1start.asp
    and add to your path the directory created by the installer
9) type 'hhc index.hhp' from the Docs\html directory. The file
    index.chm will be created.

From the base directory, you'll have to do

cd Docs
make docs-all

You'll end up with:
- a directory Docs/html containing the HTML docs
- a directory Docs/latex containing a lot of latex files you can ignore,
  plus refman.pdf and refman.ps which are their final result
- and a directory Docs/man containing the man pages.

Look in Makefile.am for additional directives
