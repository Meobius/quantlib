    Documentation for this part of the library is in progress.

    The abstract class Currency provides the interface to
    market conventions depending on the currency, such as the calendar
    used or the number of settlement days. A number of such currencies
    is contained in the Currencies namespace. Namely:

    <ul>
    <li>EUR</li>
    <li>GBP</li>
    <li>USD</li>
    </ul>
