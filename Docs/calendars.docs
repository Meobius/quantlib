    Documentation for this part of the library is in progress.

    The abstract class Calendar provides the
    interface for determining whether a date is a business day or a
    holiday for a given market, or incrementing/decrementing a date of
    a given number of business days. A number of calendars is
    contained in the Calendars namespace. Namely:

    <ul>
    <li>London</li>
    <li>NewYork</li>
    <li>TARGET</li>
    </ul>
