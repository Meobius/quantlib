/*! \page datetime Date and time calculations
    Documentation for this part of the library is in progress.

    \subsection date Dates

    The concrete class QuantLib::Date implements the concept of date.
    Its functionalities include:

    - providing basic information such as weekday, day of the month,
      day of the year, month, and year;

    - comparing two dates to determine whether they are equal, or
      which one is the earlier or later, or the difference between them
      expressed in days;

    - incrementing or decrementing a date of a given number of days,
      or of a given period expressed in weeks, months, or years.

    \subsection calendars Calendars

    The abstract class QuantLib::Calendar provides the
    interface for determining whether a date is a business day or a
    holiday for a given market, or incrementing/decrementing a date of
    a given number of business days. A number of calendars is
    contained in the QuantLib::Calendars namespace, namely,

    - Frankfurt
    - Helsinki
    - London
    - Milan
    - NewYork
    - TARGET
    - Wellington
    - Zurich


    \subsection daycounters Day counters

    The abstract class QuantLib::DayCounter provides more advanced means
    of measuring the distance between two dates according to a given
    market convention, both as number of days of fraction of year. A
    number of such conventions is contained in the QuantLib::DayCounters
    namespace, namely,

    - Actual/360
    - Actual/365
    - Actual/Actual, which can be calculated according to:
        - ISMA and US Treasury convention, also known as "Actual/Actual
          (Bond)";
        - ISDA, also known as "Actual/Actual (Historical)";
        - AFB, also known as "Actual/Actual (Euro)";
    - 30/360, which can be calculated according to:
        - USA convention;
        - European convention;
