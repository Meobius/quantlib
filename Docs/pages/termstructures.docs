/*! \page termstructures Term structures
    Documentation for this part of the library is in progress.

    The abstract class QuantLib::TermStructure provides the common
    interface to concrete term structure models. Among others, methods
    are declared which return instantaneous forward rate, discount
    factor, and zero rate at a given date. Adapter classes are provided
    which already implement part of the required methods, thus allowing
    the programmer to define only the non-redundant part. The
    PiecewiseConstantForwards class is provided as an example
    in the QuantLib::TermStructures namespace.
