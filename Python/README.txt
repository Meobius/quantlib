The suite of tests in the Tests folder is implemented on top of the PyUnit 
framework, available from http://pyunit.sourceforge.net/ and scheduled to be 
included in the Python standard library beginning with the Python 2.1 release.
The tests can be run from the Tests folder by launching the QuantLibSuite.py 
script. For platforms with a make program, they can also be run from the base 
QuantLib folder by typing "make python-test".
