SWIG (http://www.swig.org) is used to produce the Python module.
We will welcome any contribution aimed at exporting the library towards other programming languages; however, the use of SWIG will be preferred to hand-made approaches since it would allow us to maintain a single set of SWIG interfaces. The latest release of SWIG (1.3a5) supports Tcl, Perl5, Guile, MZScheme and Ruby besides Python. Java support while currently broken will be restored in the next releases.
SWIG 1.3a5 can downloaded from http://swig.sourceforge.net/download.html
