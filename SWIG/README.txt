SWIG (http://www.swig.org) is used to produce the Python module.
We welcome any contribution aimed to export the library towards
other programming languages, however, the use of SWIG is to be preferred
to hand-made approaches since it allows us to maintain a single set of SWIG
interfaces. The latest release, SWIG 1.3a5, supports Tcl, Perl5, Guile,
MZScheme and Ruby besides Python. Java support, while currently not
available, will be added in the next SWIG release.
SWIG 1.3a5 can be downloaded from http://swig.sourceforge.net/download.html
