    \brief compute value, first, and second derivatives at grid center

    $Source$
    $Log$
    Revision 1.6  2001/05/23 09:28:37  marmar
    array.hpp included

    Revision 1.5  2001/04/09 14:13:33  nando
    all the *.hpp moved below the Include/ql level

    Revision 1.4  2001/04/06 18:46:21  nando
    changed Authors, Contributors, Licence and copyright header

    Revision 1.3  2001/04/04 12:13:23  nando
    Headers policy part 2:
    The Include directory is added to the compiler's include search path.
    Then both your code and user code specifies the sub-directory in
    #include directives, as in
    #include <Solvers1d/newton.hpp>

    Revision 1.2  2001/04/04 11:07:24  nando
    Headers policy part 1:
    Headers should have a .hpp (lowercase) filename extension
    All *.h renamed to *.hpp

    Revision 1.1  2001/03/21 10:47:37  marmar
    valueAtCenter, firstDerivativeAtCenter, secondDerivativeAtCenter,
    are no longer methods of BSMNumericalOption but separate
    functions
