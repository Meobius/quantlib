A Linux port is not yet ready due to our limited experience with g++.
The main issue seems to be the lack of a complete implementation of the C++ 
template standard library in gcc. 
Any contribution is welcome as a Linux gcc port is definitely a priority.

The tentative Linux makefile is only used to produce documentation with DoxyGen.
