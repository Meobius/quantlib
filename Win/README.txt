The makefile is to be used with the free Borland C++ Compiler available at
http://www.borland.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/

Visual C++ 6.0 projects files are also supplied, but the compiled DLL does not 
work due to what seems to be a bug in the compiler. In particular, broken object
code is generated for the BSMAmericanPricer class. Please let us know whether it
works on your configuration, or if you are aware of any workarounds.
