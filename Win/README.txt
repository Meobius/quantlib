The make file is to be used with The Free Borland C++Builder Compiler (http://www.borland.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/)

Visual C++ 6.0 projects files are supplied, but there's a bug in the code
produced by the compiler. The python test Python/Tests/greeks_in_american.py
fails. If anyone fix this bug everything else should work.
