The suite of tests in the Tests folder is implemented on top of the RubyUnit 
framework, available from 
http://homepage1.nifty.com/markey/ruby/rubyunit/index_e.html
The tests can be run from the Tests folder by launching the QuantLibSuite.rb 
script. They can also be run from the base QuantLib folder by typing 
"make ruby-test".
