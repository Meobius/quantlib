            of forward-starting (a.k.a. deferred strike) options where
            the strike for each forward start option is set equal to a
            fixed percentage of the spot price at the beginning of each
            period.

            In the particular case in which only two dates are given the
            cliquet option is the same as a forward-starting
            option starting at the first date and expiring at the second
            date.
