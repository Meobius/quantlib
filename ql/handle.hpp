    //! Reference-counted pointer
    /*! This class acts as a proxy to a pointer contained in it. Such pointer 
        is owned by the handle, i.e., the handle will be responsible for its
        deletion, unless explicitly stated by the programmer.

        A count of the references to the contained pointer is incremented 
        every time a handle is copied, and decremented every time a handle is 
        deleted or goes out of scope. When the handle owns the pointer, this 
        mechanism ensures on one hand, that the pointer will not be 
        deallocated as long as a handle refers to it, and on the other hand, 
        that it will be deallocated when no more handles do.

        \note The implementation of this class was originally taken from
              "The C++ Programming Language", 3rd ed., B.Stroustrup, 
              Addison-Wesley,
              1997.

        \warning This mechanism will break and result in untimely 
                 deallocation of the pointer (and very possible death of your 
                 executable) if two handles are explicitly initialized with 
                 the same pointer, as in
        \code
        SomeObj* so = new SomeObj;
        Handle<SomeObj> h1(so);
        Handle<SomeObj> h2 = h1;    // this is safe.
        Handle<SomeObj> h3(so);     // this is definitely not.
        \endcode
                 It is good practice to create the pointer and immediately 
                 pass it to the handle, as in
        \code
        Handle<SomeObj> h1(new SomeObj);    // this is as safe as can be.
        \endcode

        \warning When the programmer keeps the ownership of the pointer, as
                 explicitly declared in
        \code
        SomeObj so;
        Handle<SomeObj> h(&so,false);
        \endcode
                 it is responsibility of the programmer to make sure that the 
                 object remain in scope as long as there are handles pointing 
                 to it. Also, the programmer must explicitly delete the 
                 object if required.

        /*! If <b>owns</b> is set to <tt>true</tt> (the default), the handle
            will be responsible for the deletion of the pointer. If it is
            set to <tt>false</tt>, the programmer must make sure that the
            pointed object remains in scope for the lifetime of the handle
            and its copies. Destruction of the object is also responsibility
            of the programmer.

            It is advised that handles be used with <tt>owns = false</tt>
            only in a controlled an self-contained environment. Such a case
            happens when an object needs to pass a handle to itself to inner
            classes or bootstrappers - i.e., contained or temporary objects
            whose lifetime is guaranteed not to last more than the lifetime
            of the object.
