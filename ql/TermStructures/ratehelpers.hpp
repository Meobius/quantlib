            bootstrap a term structure. 
            It is advised that a rate helper for an instrument contain an 
            instance of the actual instrument class to ensure consistancy 
            between the algorithms used during bootstrapping and later 
            instrument pricing. This is not yet fully enforced in the 
            available rate helpers, though - only SwapRateHelper contains a 
            Swap instrument for the time being.
