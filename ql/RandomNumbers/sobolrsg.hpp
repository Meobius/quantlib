        //! Sobol low-discrepancy sequence generator
        /*! A Gray code counter and bitwise operations are used for 
            very fast sequence generation.

            The implementation relies on primitive polynomials modulo two and
            initialization numbers from the book "Monte Carlo Methods in
            Finance" by Peter Jäckel.

            21200 primitive polynomials modulo two are provided by default.
            There are 8 129 334 polynomials as provided by Jäckel which can
            be downloaded from quantlib.org. If you need that many dimensions
            you must replace the primitivepolynomial.* files with the ones
            downloaded and recompile the library.

            The choice of initialization numbers is crucial for the homogeneity
            properties of the sequence. Jäckel's initialization numbers are
            superior to the "unit initialization" suggested in "Numerical
            Recipes in C" by Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, and Flannery.

            For more info on Sobol sequences see "Monte Carlo Methods in
            Finance", by Peter Jäckel, section 8.3 and "Numerical Recipes in
            C", 2nd edition, by Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling, and Flannery,
            section 7.7.
